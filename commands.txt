# Bring up the initial cluster. We have 4 tablets, 2 in each cell
1. ./101_initial_cluster.sh
# Show the keyspace record and the tablets

# Start with the semi-sync cluster
2. shutdown rdonly and primary's mysql
TABLET_UID=$uid ./scripts/mysqlctl-down.sh
3. Show that VTOrc repairs and promotes a different primary
4. Shutdown the new primary too.
5. This time VTOrc can't repair it.
6. Bring up a mysql again for the deleted replica and see that we can make progress
TABLET_UID=$uid ./scripts/mysqlctl-up.sh

# Now we'll take a look at the cross-cell cluster
# Take the primary mysql down and show that VTOrc repairs.
9. shutdown primary's mysql
TABLET_UID=$uid ./scripts/mysqlctl-down.sh
10. Show that VTOrc repairs and promotes a different primary
11. If the primary is in the same cell as the previous primary, reparent to one in a different cell
12. Shutdown the new primary too.
13. This time VTOrc can't repair it.
14. Delete the failed replica to show that VTOrc then repairs it.

# We finish by looking at some easier failures.
2. Stop Replication from VTAdmin
3. Show Repair
4. Stop global recoveries for VTOrc
# http://localhost:16000/api/disable-global-recoveries
5. Set Read Only from VTAdmin
6. Show the problems in VTOrc
7. Enable global recoveries for VTOrc
